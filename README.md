# Network-Automation

This is for people, who are looking to start in Network Automation, it will show you what Network Automation is and just giving you the idea of what you can do with it. 

This will be a step-by-step guied, from installing Ansible, Setting up your config for the first time, and creating your first YML file and deploying to your Network.

It will be based on Ubuntu acting as a "Ansible Server" for controlling your Network.
The Network Simulation will be in EVE-NG with Cisco Devices. (In the future I will do a How to setup your Network Simulation in EVE-NG, with Cisco/Juniper/Servers and many others)
